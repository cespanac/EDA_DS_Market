We want to let you know more about us and our project, but first we're going to share with you a little bit of our history

At Openbank, the 100% digital bank of the Santander Group, we are in the midst of a digital transformation and international expansion process. To achieve this, we are recruiting a team of great professionals, who love technology, innovation, the digital world and of course achieving great challenges. Sounds good.

We were born in 1994 as pioneers in digital banking and since then we have worked to innovate every day. Proof of this is that we launched the first native application for iPad and implemented WhatsApp as a way of communicating with our users. We currently have more than 1 million customers who have placed their trust in us, and that is why we take care of the quality and security of all our services. In 2017 we launched a new web and app platform, using the latest cloud-based technology and with an API layer for all services. That same year we created Open Digital Services (ODS), our technology subsidiary, to recruit the team that would help us achieve our greatest challenge: international growth and technological development. Today, we are developing our Core Banking and have already landed in the Netherlands, Germany and Portugal, and will soon land in Argentina.

As you can see, we haven‚Äôt stopped growing and innovating, working in a start-up format, using agile methodologies and making use of the latest technologies. We work with AWS, Microservices Architecture, Mobile Development (iOS and Android) and Big Data Ecosystems among others. Our goal is to take our users' experience to the next level. We are a flexible and fast adapting team, able to work with displaced teams and with a culture that makes us different. We have social and diversity clubs, such as our Padel or LGTBI+ Club and we have more than 30 different nationalities which allows us to have a multicultural and changing environment.

Now that you know us a little better... Would you like to join our ODS team and grow with us?

Defining new data collection and analysis processes from our different business verticals, such as wealth, insurance, or new countries.
Locate and define new process improvement opportunities
Ability to identify and automate recurring tasks (through scripts or dashboards).
Create a repository of key queries (really useful queries could be interesting for the rest of the team and for your future work).

Actualmente buscan un Data Engineer para ser el owner del desarrollo del Data Lake, Data Warehouse, aportando los mejores m√©todos y de la mejor forma para la ingesti√≥n de datos.

Equipo: Estar√°s trabajando con otros 3 data analyst, la head de data, y en estrecha colaboraci√≥n con el DevOps y el equipo IT.

El must de stack: Actualmente est√°n migrando todo su data stack a Google Cloud (Bigquery, Composer). Pero, conocedores de que no es tan com√∫n el expertise de esta herramienta en el mercado (aunque cada vez se usa m√°s), estar√≠an buscando a alguien que venga de AWS (Redshift y dem√°s) as√≠ como Airflow, y tampoco una excesiva seniority, porque la idea es que tenga los fundamentos y dentro de la empresa poder formarse y crecer.

(Remote, Full-Time, Anywhere in the World)
 Small niche companies are becoming increasingly successful in the expanding and highly differentiated marketplace we are in today. At Deep Consulting Solutions, we help these companies grow big while staying effective and delivering the best to their clients by replacing their inefficient business processes with automation.

 Do you want to be part of a no-nonsense consultancy that grows successful and effective businesses using business process improvement and customized software that effectively executes business tasks? Our global consulting team is looking for Business Analysts to automate business processes and restructure them for greater efficiency.
 
LinkedIn has limited this job posting to 10,000 characters and we are unable to have the full job posting text here. Please click ""Apply"" and you will be taken to our webpage where you will see the complete job posting text including the requirements for the job, conditions of work, details of hiring process and will be able to start your application.


 What We Do  
We find niche and successful small companies who have problems running their complex internal productions as they scale. Our clients include custom manufacturers, installers, concierge medicine providers, financial services providers, and other custom/concierge service companies. Their operational processes require a lot of manual decisions and it is hard to find and train up employees to execute all these business jobs correctly. We help them lower the need to rely on employees by putting in place automation that will either entirely carry out business jobs or will instruct, organize, and monitor the employees in such a way that employees will have to carry out the least decisions, problematic employees will be quickly identified and the business will be able to produce more with fewer employees and with less management effort by the business owner. Our company carries out the entire service in house, whereby we investigate the business, evaluate it, develop new business processes that will optimize the business and then develop and implement software solutions that will execute their automated business tasks within those new processes.
 Our company guarantees success of our projects to our clients - meaning that if for any reason they aren't satisfied with the outcome, we will take down what we've built and give them their money back. As a result there is a very high demand for and expectation of quality from all staff. We are only looking for people who can produce high quality deliverables and get things done completely and well.


Work Process and Team Structure 
Our company operates on a rigid process and employs a large variety of functional experts in the team. All projects follow a sequence in which our clients' business operation is first thoroughly analyzed and investigated by the Business Analyst who ends up putting together a thorough analysis and and understanding of the business processes used as-is, then evaluates the business model and proposes business model improvements that can be implemented with automation and better process structuring which are then reviewed with Deep Consulting Solutions Owner and then approved upon with the client. The Business Analyst then develops highly detailed theoretical models which will be the modification of all current business processes and models with the agreed upon business improvements and automation implemented into them, that is in effect the target business model that we will be trying to achieve with our project. The target business model is then used to formulate the requirements for a software solution to be put together in order to carry out its business jobs, which is then designed by the software design team, designs are reviewed by the Business Analyst for business model relevance and completeness, and once approved, the software solution is built by our engineering team. Once a software solution is put together and vetted for its quality, it is then assessed by the Business Analyst, and implemented into the business operation - during which, the Business Analyst oversees the implementation and makes sure that the business operation experiences the necessary outcomes out of the project.

In parallel to the above, we also automate relevant accounting processes as part of this process and have dedicated Accounting Procedures & Processes Analysts on our team for that purpose, and the business analyst works closely with them to make sure the accounting processes are an exact fit and match to the business processes implemented. This is incorporated into the above process.

The project teams are kept small in order to make projects easier to organize and to ensure personal responsibility. A project team usually consists of a Business Analyst who is on a project full time, Deep Consulting Solutions Owner who reviews all top level business improvements and keeps an eye on projects quality and execution, other Business Analysts providing peer review, an Accounting Analyst who is usually part-time split between projects, two Software Product Designers who carry out functional design for the software solution and make sure that the solution operates properly and meets the requirements along our tech team which consists of many Software Engineers and Quality Assurance Engineers who usually don't interface with Business Analysts directly but work with the Product Designers who in turn work with the Business Analysts.



What We Will Expect From You 
As the Business Analyst, your ultimate deliverable will be the effectively improved state of client's business delivered through Deep Consulting Solutions' method. This will require of you to both thoroughly and rigorously analyze the client business as it is and to develop business process improvements that can be accomplished through automation and business process restructuring and then to ensure proper implementation of such improvements into the clients' business both with our software implementations and with other business changes not directly connected to software. We will expect you to carry out complete and thorough analysis and make correct decisions and deliver most effectively - in short our expectations will be very high. In order to meet such expectations, you will definitely need to exercise the following at all times (the list is not exhaustive but provides the basic listing of what you will need to exercise at all times):


Carry our truthful, complete, and thorough analysis of the relevant situations, rigorously evaluate all the circumstances and ensure that you understand why things happen the way they do;
Exercise rigorous reasoning in your evaluations and business model proposals, considering all the circumstances and making sure that your evaluations and proposed improvements/business process solutions will be based on facts, aware of and work with the real circumstances of the situation and will not contain plain unjustified assumptions;
Exercise practical awareness in your solutions and business improvement proposals, making sure that what you propose will be practically implementable and will bring the intended result in the given situation;
Carry out your analysis, evaluation and modeling with a high degree of precision and attention to detail, with details being consistent throughout;
Exercise critical evaluation and thinking at all times with regards to your own work and the work of other people who you will either review or peer-review;
Communicate in effective and clear ways that will ensure that the result will be effectively accomplished not only by you but also by other members of the team in such a way that the project overall succeeds.

Generally, you will be free to decide how you structure your work, so long as you produce effective results that meet our quality standard and lead to successfully completed projects. You will be held accountable for the outcomes of your actions, and not your activities. Your given level of responsibility will be determined by your performance, which will be assessed after every project that you complete, leading to matching results in your compensation.

Ironhack,Mid-Senior Data Analyst,"Madrid, Comunidad de Madrid, Espa√±a",Publicado hace hace 1 mes,456 visualizaciones,Algo de responsabilidad,Servicios y tecnolog√≠as de la informaci√≥n Software Internet,Media jornada,Tecnolog√≠a de la informaci√≥n,"#About Ironhack

Ironhack is an education startup that was founded to disrupt the way tech education works!

Doesn‚Äôt it seem odd that we‚Äôve been learning the same way since the Industrial Revolution? Virtually all industries are pushing the limits on how to do things faster, better, and more efficiently. Yet, for the most part, people feel stuck on a 4+ year (and usually quite expensive) path that often results in an unfulfilling career path.

We empower students to create a new path - one that leads to meaningful careers in software development, product design or data analytics in a fraction of the time and cost of traditional education.

Our higher purpose is to transform the education space to be unapologetically outcomes-driven. Whether students are looking to change careers, get a promotion, skip University, or start their own company, we work tirelessly every day to make sure this path is as quick, immersive, and accessible as possible. Hearing these success stories is what gets us out of bed each day, excited to come to work :)

It‚Äôs with this mindset that we‚Äôve become one of the key global players in bridging the digital skills gap, serving both those looking to get into tech, as well as the companies hungry for tech talent.

Quick Facts
Founded in 2013 by Wharton and Harvard grads
Operations in Miami, Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Mexico City, Lisbon, Amsterdam, Sao Paulo and Berlin
100% YoY Growth (help us to keep it going!)
Graduated over 6500 students
100+ global team members
Venture capital backed
About The Gig

A large part of the success of Ironhack depends on the data we have. The Data Analyst plays a critical role in ensuring we have good quality and accessibility to our the data, enabling us to make better decisions for our students.

We‚Äôre looking for a Data Analyst that will work transforming Ironhack into a more data-driven organization. The role is based in Madrid, although we will work remotely from Spain (we may want to meet onsite from time to time).

Ironhack is becoming a data-driven organization; we are in the early stages of it, so you will be key in achieving it as a Data Analyst.

We Are Working Hard On Three Main Points
Making data available to everyone (developing a platform that provides accessibility and autonomy to the employees to query the data)
Spreading the knowledge of data around the company: an essential part of autonomy is to be able to extract valuable knowledge from the data. That‚Äôs why we are training all the Ironhack‚Äôs employees on necessary data skills.
Improving the quality of our data: data is useless if the quality is low. We are working hard on being aware of the quality of the data.
In the future, we‚Äôll work also on providing Advanced Analytics to the company, such as forecasting, clustering, and different Machine Learning and statistics techniques. So the challenges are varied, and you will be able to develop yourself in different areas.

You will be close to
Technical aspects of the data such as analysis, quality, reporting, and generation
Non-technical aspects of the data: working on our culture, helping people to be autonomous
You will be responsible for
Definition, analysis, design, and development of data quality models
Definition, analysis, design, and development of analytical processes and models
Training employees in basic data skills such as dashboarding, querying and analyzing data
Developing business cases to focus on the market with higher potential impact
Data lineage and governance
Your day-to-day. We work with agile methodologies, so you will know your priorities, but also you will be responsible for how you plan your day-to-day work.
Your Skills And Experience
At least 3 years of experience as Data Analyst
Degree in a Quantitative field or related courses
Demonstrated knowledge of BI projects
Demonstrated hands-on experience with a programming language (R, Python, etc)
Demonstrated experience on relational databases: design, manipulate and query the data in Postgresql
Data Preparation (Cleansing and Standardization). Use of Python to transform, clean and store data in different formats.
Analytic models: proven knowledge and experience on classical models (classification, regression, time series, clustering, etc.)
Being a team player is a must
Hands-on experience building a strong governance environment
Experience in working and delivering end-to-end projects independently
Liking and understanding how to work in an agile environment
Comfortable with English speaking
What we offer in the data team
The possibility to learn about many different business processes: we work with the marketing team, education, sales, etc. You will learn what their main processes are and how they use the data
The possibility to work with people from different countries. It is always interesting to know better different cultures
We are a small team with high impact
30 - 35k gross year, depending on the profile
Is this you?
Passionate about education and technology!
Comfortable embracing a culture of constant experimentation
Really positive, upbeat, and social
Encouraged by challenges and enjoy having tons of autonomy with no bureaucratic BS

We want to let you know more about us and our project, but first we're going to share with you a little bit of our history

At Openbank, the 100% digital bank of the Santander Group, we are in the midst of a digital transformation and international expansion process. To achieve this, we are recruiting a team of great professionals, who love technology, innovation, the digital world and of course achieving great challenges. Sounds good.

We were born in 1994 as pioneers in digital banking and since then we have worked to innovate every day. Proof of this is that we launched the first native application for iPad and implemented WhatsApp as a way of communicating with our users. We currently have more than 1 million customers who have placed their trust in us, and that is why we take care of the quality and security of all our services. In 2017 we launched a new web and app platform, using the latest cloud-based technology and with an API layer for all services. That same year we created Open Digital Services (ODS), our technology subsidiary, to recruit the team that would help us achieve our greatest challenge: international growth and technological development. Today, we are developing our Core Banking and have already landed in the Netherlands, Germany and Portugal, and will soon land in Argentina.

As you can see, we haven‚Äôt stopped growing and innovating, working in a start-up format, using agile methodologies and making use of the latest technologies. We work with AWS, Microservices Architecture, Mobile Development (iOS and Android) and Big Data Ecosystems among others. Our goal is to take our users' experience to the next level. We are a flexible and fast adapting team, able to work with displaced teams and with a culture that makes us different. We have social and diversity clubs, such as our Padel or LGTBI+ Club and we have more than 30 different nationalities which allows us to have a multicultural and changing environment.

Now that you know us a little better... Would you like to join our ODS team and grow with us?

We are waiting for you!

At Returnly, we help brands that care about shopper loyalty offer better product returns.

We are on a mission to de-risk online commerce and are building a team of amazingly talented people to help us do it.

About The Role

Schedule

We have a very flexible approach to working hours. You can stop to go to the gym, get your little ones to or from school, meditate or do whatever you need or want. There is a need for a certain amount of overlap with Pacific Coast working hours needed for meetings and collaboration that does not fit into asynchronous communications, however we try to prioritise those, and your main collaborators are based on Spain. A lot of people at Returnly have families, we understand the sometimes unpredictable nature of life and we support everyone taking care of their loved ones and themselves, and we trust everyone to take advantage of this flexibility in a responsible way.

Equipment

You will be provided with an Apple laptop and whatever you need to do your job comfortably and productively. As we are now unable to enjoy our awesome offices, special provisions to help you set up at home will be addressed.

We integrate the complete process of selecting, hiring, and managing employees, being the first in digitizing all the steps, introducing Artificial Intelligence solutions in multiple phases, obtaining faster and higher-quality service for our clients, and great satisfaction and loyalty for our workers.
Our Impact on Society: Our vision is to create a long-term job security condition for our workers while providing flexible solutions to our clients. We can do this by concatenating different short-term contracts and minimizing‚Äìor completely removing‚Äìtheir unemployed time. We want to remove the need for finding a job ever again. 
Data-Driven: Being the owner of the entire hiring funnel, workforce management, and working experience, give us very unique data that we transform into powerful knowledge to make better decisions, improve job-candidate matches, estimate quality and affinity, and share performance feedback with our workers and clients. We are the most advanced workforce on-demand company thanks to our data and the way we use it.
Great Challenges for the Data Team: Integrating very different AI solutions to improve the experience for both our workers and employers (Shift Optimization, Machine Learning algorithms, Quality Score Estimations, Document recognition, etc.), relying on a very powerful ETL that permits endless automatizations while keeping the focus on data quality.
Growth Overview: An annual growth of 170%, available in multiple countries: the UK, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Mexico, Colombia, France, and more are coming. HQ in Madrid with a second big presence in Barcelona and some remote workers in the UK, The Netherlands, and the USA. And finally, some of our great clients are Amazon, XPOLogistics, Cabify, Santander, Just Eat, etc. 

Join us in one of the hottest startups in Spain, breaking into a new market worldwide, learning and contributing with your expertise in innovating the entire job market!
 Be the main referent of our Python code, help to raise the quality bar of any Python code we use. 

We use Airflow as our ETL, a very powerful Python framework that allows us to break down any complex problem/process into smaller ones. Each component can be implemented directly in Python, or in any other language since they could be docker images executed in ECS instances. 

The main priority is a senior profile with extremely solid Python skills, previous experience with Data/ETL is nice-to-have but it is not mandatory.

Overall, we can resume the main responsibilities as follow:
Raise the level of our Python good practices, code structure, cleaning, and testing.
Design and implement high-quality and performant Python code within our powerful ETL.
Automate external integrations with our Data Lake and Data Warehouse.
Automate complex solutions that might require to train, build, and deploy a series of Machine Learning algorithms (no previous experience with ML required). 
 In addition, we are looking for a senior profile that could be interested in:
Mentor mid- and junior- Python Engineer: given the great impact of our ETL on the entire company, we want to grow a team dedicated to it, capable of improving, maintaining, and boosting it even further.
Sharing her/his knowledge inside and outside Jobandtalent, raising the quality standards of the entire team with the aim of growing together.
Contributing to Open Source projects: we are using different Open Source frameworks and libraries, and one of our wishes would be to contribute to some of those projects, dedicating part of our time when possible. 

Requirements and Skills
Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Math, Engineering, Stats, or Quantitative field.
4+ years of proven experience programming in Python with production-ready code (not scripting code).
Extremely skilled programmer (e.g., unittest, production/staging experience).
Experience with
Different kinds of standard databases (e.g., RDBMS, NoSQL).
Container development with Docker or Kubernetes.

Stream processing framework (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, Spark, Flink).
A valid work permit to be employed in Spain.
Fluent in English is a must.

Examples of Projects and Responsibilities
You receive a Jupyter Notebook made by one of our Data Analysts which contained a prototype of a data processing pipeline that generate very important data for our stakeholder. The Data Analyst has previously confirmed the data is corrected, but the code is definitely not ready for production. You need to understand it, define which is the best way to automate it (Airflow Python DAG, using Spark, external tools, etc.), and start the implementation by yourself or together with other team members.
The previous example works in a similar way for Data Scientists when they come requesting help with automation about how to train a Machine Learning model that we want to re-evaluate on a weekly basis. Ideally, we want the results of the evaluation to be automatically computed and shared via a Slack channel, so we can quickly review them and decide if the model can be moved to production.
We are expecting you to raise the quality bar of our code: helping your team members understanding which is the best way to structure the code for a specific problem, defining better protocols, introducing metrics when they are missing, improve the code performance, etc.

Offer in Short
Great ownership of the projects with a direct impact on the product.
Salary in the 55-70k range (wide range, depending on experience).
Transparent Equity package.
Discount on Health insurance.
A yearly budget for Conferences/meetup/self-learning.
Working in an international and multidisciplinary team 
You will be working in the Data Science team (read the last blog posts), together with Full-stack Engineers, Data Scientists, and Data Analysts.

Pero ahora sigo)Equipo: Estar√°s trabajando con otros 3 data analyst, la head de data, y en estrecha colaboraci√≥n con el DevOps y el equipo IT.El must de stack: Actualmente est√°n migrando todo su data stack a Google Cloud (Bigquery, Composer). Pero, conocedores de que no es tan com√∫n el expertise de esta herramienta en el mercado (aunque cada vez se usa m√°s), estar√≠an buscando a alguien que venga de AWS (Redshift y dem√°s) as√≠ como Airflow, y tampoco una excesiva seniority, porque la idea es que tenga los fundamentos y dentro de la empresa poder formarse y crecer. A destacar que como Benefit ellos tienen suscripci√≥n a una famosa plataforma de aprendizaje, as√≠ como tienen asignado tiempo semanal, en horario laboral, para formarse.Softskills: Ambiente incre√≠ble, dicho por varios miembros del equipo, ya que los conocemos desde hace tiempo. Buscar√≠an a alguien din√°mico, que le mole el ecosistema startup, y no le de miedo lanzarse a la piscina a aprender cosas nuevas y √∫ltimas tecnolog√≠as.
Y esto no es todo, adem√°s de un paquete de benefits al que habr√≠a que a√±adir mucho team building, y clases de idiomas, se a√±ade su pol√≠tica 100% remote friendly (aunque restringido por ahora a las personas en el mismo huso horario que Espa√±a), por lo que, si as√≠ lo quieres, y m√°s all√° del COVID, puedes continuar trabajando desde tu casa, la cafeter√≠a o un lugar paradis√≠aco de la costa ?

Our mission is to supply a continuous stream of accurate data and insight into what the world thinks so that companies, governments and institutions can better serve the people and communities that sustain them.
We have the best data and the best tools. We continuously challenge conventional approaches to research, and we disrupt our industry to ensure that our clients always get the best solutions.
We are driven by a set of shared values. We are fast, fearless and innovative. We work diligently to get it right. We are guided by accuracy, ethics and proven methodologies. We trust each other and bring these values into everything that we do.
Job DescriptionYou will help build some of the largest and most innovative research data products in the world. YouGov has 20 years of historical survey data including billions of data points across dozens of countries. In this position, you will own how we structure, standardize, process, and analyze that data internally ‚Äî so that we can then build cutting edge data products for our external customers. You‚Äôll be building data models for our users for the years to come.
If you think of yourself as a ‚Äúdata generalist‚Äù or a ‚Äúdata wrangler,‚Äù this position is a perfect fit for you. This isn‚Äôt a position for a pure statistician, data modeler, or a machine learning specialist.
Every day will be very different than the day before. An example day might be something like this:
The night before, a user opened a ticket with a puzzling question about some metadata. Your morning starts with data detective work to identify the issue, and you discover an anomaly. You realize there‚Äôs a historical inconsistency in some metadata, so you write code in Python or R to parse out that metadata, clean it, and standardize it. Then you update ETLs to Redshift to reflect the new metadata, and you add functionality to the web-frontend tool you built to allow users to search through that metadata in a new way.

Responsibilities

Collect data from various data sources including survey instrument, APIs, and relational databases, including the tens of thousands of survey questions and billions of answers
Perform exploratory data analysis
Assess the effectiveness and accuracy of new data sources and data gathering techniques
Develop scripts, workflows, and ETL pipelines for data pre-processing, cleaning and model inputs.
Deploy statistical models developed by senior data scientists into production environments, with a focus on accuracy, speed, and efficiency.
Build and maintain summary dashboards of key survey information for tracking purposes
Develop and deploy processes and tools to monitor and analyze pipeline performance and data accuracy

QualificationsDemonstrated Knowledge And Experience

2 years of Data Science experience, with an engineering focus
Demonstrated experience working cross-functionally with engineering, product, and data science teams

Technical Skills
Experience using Python and SQL; R helpful as well
Experience using tools such as Pandas to manipulate data and draw insights from data sets rapidly
Preferably, experience working as a data engineer/analyst in a cloud-based environment, using AWS (preferred), GCP or Azure
Ideally experience building small tools or interfaces for less technical users to interact with data
Soft Skills
You‚Äôre resourceful
You deal well with open ended problems (i.e., figuring out the right questions to ask about a data set) rather than being told exactly what to analyze or how to analyze it
You consider yourself to be an excellent ‚Äúdata wrangler‚Äù
A drive to learn and master new technologies and techniques
A collaborative mindsetAdditional InformationThis role can be 100% remote.

COVID19 is accelerating digitalization at both the consumer and enterprise level, so the adoption of communication automation solutions therefore is skyrocketing.

In three years Landbot has gone from a chatbot builder MVP to a product with thousands of recurring customers who use it daily to get more and better leads across the whole world. This is possible thanks to our builder, a centerpiece of the product, which allows non-technical people to build engaging conversational experiences.

What's the opportunity

We‚Äôre looking for a Data Analyst to become a centerpiece in the company as the first member in the Business Intelligence Team.

You‚Äôll work together with all departments (Marketing, Sales, Product, Finance...) in order to build a data-driven culture and improve our performance.

You‚Äôre excited to switch between working with sales and customer success team to minimize churn one day, marketing to set up their attribution tracking systems the next, while structuring the product analytics team the other day.

You‚Äôre intimately familiar with the technical side of business intelligence work, but at the same time are able to think on a company-wide, strategic level.

You will be responsible to setup the foundation for data frameworks, resources and tools with freedom to define such centerpieces at the company level.

Understand the business needs and produce insightful analyses for sales, marketing and product teams. Act as an internal consultant to translate business questions such as ""what is the effect of one product change over other KPI‚Äôs"" into insights and opportunities. Build robust relationships with key business stakeholders. Help colleagues to access to the right data and understand what it reveals. Create hypothesis, collect data to either support or disprove the hypothesis and recommend solutions to help move a metric. Identify business opportunities based on a combination of internal and external data sets. Synthesize complex data and present clear recommendations to senior management.
Job requirements
4+ years in a similar role at a SaaS company. Deep understanding of SaaS business and metrics to provide KPI insights and data guidance. Degree ideally in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Computer Science or related degree or Economics/Business. Strong knowledge of SQL ‚Äì optimization of big data queries and Airflow are a plus. Knowledge of Data Modelling, be able to program in Python and/or R. Extremely organized with the ability to work on and manage multiple projects within tight timelines. Proven track record of defining and executing key analysis with minimal supervision. Strong attention to detail. The ability to data mine across a large and varied business area or key priority for the company. Great reporting skills being able to transform data into intuitive dashboards, reports and insights. Very strong communicator, both written & verbally.
